                    We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from 
                    unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. To ensure the confidentiality, 
                    integrity, and availability of personal data that is collected; organizational, 
                    administrative, and technical processes and procedures are put in place to

                    The web application is built using Django as a framework of python, which are 
                    using encryption and hashing. By default, Django uses the PBKDF2 algorithm 
                    with a SHA256 hash, a password stretching mechanism recommended 
                    by NIST. Which is sufficient for most users, it’s quite secure, requiring 
                    massive amounts of computing time to break. By the use of encryption and 
                    hashing, it can protect sensitive data. Data is mostly stored in the database in 
                    human-readable format which is usually encrypted it python package django-cryptography.
